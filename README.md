This project involves analyzing the delivery charges levied by multiple courier companies by an ecommerce company (let's call it X) in India. 
X receives around a thousand orders per day through their website, which they have to deliver as fast as possible. 
For this, they have tied up with multiple courier companies in India as delivery partners who charge them a certain amount per delivery based on two factors: 
weight of the product and the distance between the warehouse (pickup location) and customer's delivery address (destination location).

On average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. 
However, if X ships 1,00,000 orders per month, they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly basis as charges. 
As this amount is significantly high, X wants to verify if the charges levied by their delivery partners per order are correct.

The goal of this project is to perform a thorough analysis of the delivery charges levied by the courier companies and to verify if they are correct. 
This will help X to identify any discrepancies and negotiate better rates with their delivery partners, 
which can lead to significant cost savings for the company.
